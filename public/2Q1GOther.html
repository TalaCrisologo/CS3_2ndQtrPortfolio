        <td><p> Assassination Classroom is about this school that ranks their students based on their<br>
                performance. The E-Class kids get this yellow-octopus teacher that moves at Mach 20 and<br>
                they have to kill him by the end of the year. I got really emotional with this anime, even<br>
                if it was comedic and light-hearted for the most part. Their teacher actually teaches them<br>
                well and gets their grades up. He also helps them become better people / think better of<br>
                themselves. I love everyone's character development and I liked the ending. I'd definitely<br>
                rewatch this if I had more time. The relationship between Class-E and Koro-sensei is really<br>
                sweet.

        <td><p> I don't even play volleyball and I LOVE Haikyuu. I've rewatched this anime so many<br>
                times and I love everything about it. It's a pretty basic sports anime in the sense that<br>
                it celebrates teamwork, has training arcs, and slice of life difficulties for the characters.<br>
                I like how it doesn't just focus on the protagonists, and gives every character feelings,<br>
                like the seniors who know that their freshmen are better players than them but still want<br>
                to play because it might be their last chance to in high school. I appreciated this anime<br>
                more when I became part of Alianti, because I related more to it.<br>

        <td><p> Sk8 The Infinity is the first skateboarding anime/show I've ever seen. I really enjoyed<br>
                all the episodes they're all very light-hearted, and the characters go through getting<br>
                better at their craft together. I rewatch this a lot because it's a pretty short anime.<br>
                I like how Reki and Langa, the two protagonists deal with their emotions because their<br>
                friendship is realistic (as someone their age).

        <td><p> I used to watch Inuyasha Tagalog Dub on my TV when I was around 5 years old. I<br>
                rewatched it again recently because I wanted to appreciate it more. I like the world-building<br>
                in this anime. The storyline is pretty slow, so I needed a LOT of time to complete it. It<br>
                also gets kinda repetitive because most of it is just Inuyasha coming to save the day, <br>
                but I still like all the characters in this anime.<br>

        <td><p> Tokyo Revengers is an anime that follows this guy who traveled back into his teenage self's<br>
                body with the original goal of saving his highschool girlfriend who died. He gets roped into<br>
                a gang, and it quickly becomes his goal to save his friends in the gangs he gets involved in.<br>
                The pacing isn't my favorite, but I like the writing and love all the characters and<br>
                their backstories.<br>
